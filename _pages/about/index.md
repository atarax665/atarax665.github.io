Hey, I’m Abhinav Anand. I’m currently a **software engineer - 2** on the **Instamart B2B** team at **Swiggy**. There, I focus on building a product to empower kirana store owners and ease the procurement flow for them. I work **remotely** from my home at **Patna, Bihar**.

When I’m not building stuff at Swiggy, you can find me building tools for myself, working out, completing my daily steps or reading fiction/non-fiction/tech book.

Outside of my full-time, **I occasionally take on freelance work**. If you’re looking for someone to work with to develop your MVP, revamp your existing product etc, feel free to [drop me a line](mailto:itsatarax@gmail.com).

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/atarax665), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/xxabhinav), and [Medium](https://medium.com/@atarax).
