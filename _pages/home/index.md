Hi, my name is Abhinav Anand. I'm a software engineer living in Patna, India. I work remotely, and when I’m not coding, I’m likely at the gym or immersed in a good book. Fitness keeps me grounded, and reading fuels my curiosity beyond the screen. Sometimes I write. Here’s what I’m up to [now](/now).

## What I Do

I build web applications from concept to deployment, focusing on performance, usability, and maintainable code.

## My Approach

I believe in simple solutions, clear communication, and continuous learning. Quality over quantity, always.
